OMG, just finished watching the G20 and honestly, what a freaking circus, haha. I mean, some parts were kinda hopeful, but you know how these things go. There were moments I was like, Is this a world leaders’ gathering or a reality show reunion? Seriously, I feel like I need a mental detox after this. I was so into it, didn’t even think about getting snacks. Imagine that?

Honestly though, some of the speeches were a rollercoaster. I get it, saving the world is hard work and all, but sometimes it feels like they’re just saying stuff cuz they feel they have to, not ‘cause they really want to make a difference, ya feel me? There was one bit that was actually inspiring but then ZOOM — they’re off to some other topic. What's up with that?

> And can we talk about the awkward handshakes? It’s like they need a course on chillin’ out or something. But hey, there’s hope, right? Maybe they’ll have a seminar next year titled “How to Not Be Awkward 101.” Would download the movie of that in a heartbeat. LOL.

Btw, did you watch the movie yet? You know which one I mean. If not, you need to before your brain turns into a G20 mess. Trust me, it’ll be a nice break from world politics and save you from a headache. 😂

Anyway, back to the debacle. Was anything actually solved, or did they just agree to disagree? I had to rewind a few times, like, “What? Did they just nod and smile in five languages?” Haha, like a global version of smile-and-wave.

Jeez, here I am rambling again. Let me breathe. But OK, one good thing—at least these leaders didn't fall asleep mid-speech, right? Remember that one time with the mic drop, mid-sentence? ROFL, good times. Maybe we should get a betting pool for next time!

Anyway, gotta tell you, I feel a weird mix of hope and disillusionment. Like, I want to believe things are headed somewhere good, but man, I also want to just chuck my thoughts out the window and vibe for a bit, you know? Maybe it’s the irony of caring about things we can’t change, or maybe it's just late... Who knows! 🙃
